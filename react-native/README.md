Frontend setup (React-Native)

This application works over expo client, so for development you need to add expo, follow below steps:

Mote: This project is built on npm version `6.14.11` and node version `v14.16.0`

Pre-requisites: npm installed on your system

steps:

1. Open the terminal/cmd and type

`npm install -g expo-cli`

once expo installed, go to the root directory of this app and type

`npm i`

then

`expo start`

You can get your metro bundle in terminal as well as default browser, choose option on how you want to run your app, I made it work by installing expo client into mobile and making connection of physical mobile device via USB and selecting "Run on Android device/emulator" option, with "tunnel" connection mode.
